# Sudoku library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joosephook/sudokulib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joosephook/sudokulib)

## Overview

This C++ project contains a Sudoku implementation that can be used to create and solve different sudokus.
In addition, it contains a multi-threaded implementation of a simple sudoku solver that uses a very simple algorithm for
solving sudokus.
The solver can be used from the command-line with many switches.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to learn to use modern C++ features, its build tool (CMake), a third-party library (Boost)
and using Travis CI.

## TODO

* Copy sudokus from the source directory to build directory using CMake commands
* Test the solver with the simplest sudokus using different combinations of flags
